            objective:'Build a static business website with a contact form. Mobile friendly a must.', 
            challenges:'I encountered an issue when setting state for different input types on the form. The difficulty was in saving the multi-selection form input values to be returned. I tried to condense my code by using a single onChange event, but later reverted to multiple onChange events and the problem was solved.',
            learned:'New things I learned through building this project are React concepts useState(updates DOM when state changes) and useRef(does not update DOM when state changes), using multi-selection form inputs, and working with EmailJS & reCaptcha v2. '

            challenges:'The biggest frustration for this site was deciding when to use grid vs flex. Optimizing the bird animation for mobile was tedious but worth it!',
            learned:'Birds make a beautiful color pallette! I learned more about React-Router (enables client-side routing), React-player (component for playing URLs on the web page) and practiced using props. The project page layout was designed in Figma and the logo was designed in Adobe Illustrator.'

            challenges:'I struggled to solve the JavaScript "one day" discrepancy when using JavaScript Date objects. I feel this code could be condensed even further by moving the innerHTML properties outside of the if-else statement, but further exploration is needed to make it work. ',
            learned:'Calculations with dates is easier using Python vs JavaScript, mostly because of Pythons dayOfYear function.  In JavaScript, I had to convert all dates to milliseconds (epoch time) and maneuver through timezones to get a correct date result. '

            challenges:'After deployment, the page was rendering 20 cards instead of 16 cards. This caused my winner modal to pop up before all cards were flipped. My environment variables werenâ€™t set up correctly in Netlify. So, I added my API key to Netlify environment variables and now it works like a charm.',

            objective:'Deploy app that make a list of chores held in a database. Clicking the chore deletes the chore from the database and from the app.', 
            challenges:'One challenge I experienced was that my data doubled when rendering to the DOM. I learned that could not just append the new chore to the end of the list and have it appear on screen. Once the new chore was appended, the database changes trigger the list to be rendered again. To prevent duplication, I had to clear the DOM before appending the new chore to the list.',
            learned:'I learned a lot about working with a realtime database, such as Firebases onValue() function which listens for data changes at a specific location, and returns a snapshot of the data object.  '
